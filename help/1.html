<h3>EliteOCR is not finding the system name</h3>
Checklist:<br>
1. Verbose logging was enabled in AppConfig.xml (resets with every game update)<br>
2. After adding verbose logging game was restarted and system was changed<br>
3. Screenshots were made AFTER the former points were done<br>
4. Log directory was set properly in EliteOCR<br><br>

If not, do it or continue reading for more information<br><br>

EliteOCR looks for system names in the log directory of Elite: Dangerous.
Additionally VerboseLogging="1" has to be added in the game's AppConfig.xml.
<br><br>
You can find the logs in (your installation path)\EDLaunch\Products\FORC-FDEV-D-1002\Logs
<br>
AppConfig.xml should be in (your installation path)\EDLaunch\Products\FORC-FDEV-D-1002\
<br>
If you cannot find it use the search function of windows or search on the forum.
<br><br>
Should you still have problems make sure to do the following:
<br><br>
- If you just enabled verbose logging make sure to fly first to another system and make screenshots there.
Elite: Dangerous is only adding info to log files after you changed the settings. Screenshots made before will not work.
<br><br>
- Always do screenshots in the game with F10. Screenshots made by 3rd party tools will not have corresponding entries in logs.
<br><br>
- Check if the screenshot and system names after jumping are listed in the log file. If not recheck your configuration in AppConfig.xml
<br><br>
Your Appconfig.xml should look similar to this:
<div style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa">
&lt;Network<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port=&quot;0&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upnpenabled=&quot;1&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LogFile=&quot;netLog&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DatestampLog=&quot;1&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VerboseLogging=&quot;1&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/Network&gt;<br>
