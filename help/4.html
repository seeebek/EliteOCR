<h3>Commodities frequently misspelled</h3>

EliteOCR uses tesseract for first recognition and then checks the results against a dictionary.
You can check and edit the dictionary in Settings > Commodity editor. 
<br><br>
If a commodity is always misspelled or recognized as other commodity please check your commodity list in
the commodity editor and correct all faulty entries. You might also add entries by hand.
The entries are sorted upon saving and the duplicates are deleted.
