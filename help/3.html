<h3>Numbers missing in OCR results</h3>

It can happen that EliteOCR misses some numbers while reading the screenshot.
<br>
This happens actually only if you use screenshots smaller than 1920 by 1080px. It is not recommended
<<<<<<< HEAD
to use EliteOCR with such screenshots. Additionally you will be forced to wait 1,5 seconds on every line you process.
=======
to use EliteOCR with such screenshots. Additionally the export function to BPC and EDDN is disabled
in this case. You still would be able to export to xlsx, csv and ods.
>>>>>>> origin/dev

Should you have the problem even if you use screenshots of 1080 or higher:
<br><br>
- If you changed the field of view setting in the game files the resulting resolution might be
significantly lower. I recommend using the standard FOV settings in the game.
<br><br>
- If you changed brightness, contrast or gamma settings in the game please reset those to standard.
EliteOCR is sensitive to color changes in screenshots.
<br><br>
- If you changed the interface color in the game files please revert it to standard(orange).
